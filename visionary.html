                    <p class="body-text">
                        Charles Babbage (1791–1871) was a British mathematician, philosopher, inventor,
                        and mechanical engineer. He lived during the Industrial Revolution, a period when
                        machines were transforming manufacturing, transport, and society. Babbage believed
                        that the same precision used in industry could be applied to mathematics—reducing
                        human error and improving reliability.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text">
                        At the time, important industries relied on large printed mathematical tables
                        (for navigation, engineering, astronomy, and finance). These tables often contained
                        mistakes because they were calculated manually by teams of “human computers.”
                        Babbage saw these errors as dangerous and wasteful, especially when lives and money
                        depended on accurate calculations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text">
                        His response was bold: if repetitive factory work could be mechanised, then repetitive
                        calculation could be mechanised too. This idea led to his designs for mechanical
                        calculating machines—most famously the <strong>Difference Engine</strong> and the
                        <strong>Analytical Engine</strong>. Even though his full designs were not completed
                        in his lifetime, the concepts behind them strongly resemble modern computing.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="box-heading" style="margin-top:18px;">Why he matters to Computer Science</h2>
                    <p class="body-text">
                        Babbage’s most important contribution was not just building machinery—it was the
                        architecture of an information-processing system. He described components that map
                        surprisingly well to modern computers: a place to store numbers (memory), a place to
                        operate on them (processor), and a method for controlling sequences of operations
                        (control flow). These core principles sit underneath everything from laptops to phones.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-text">
                        His work also shows how computer science is not only about electronics. The “computer”
                        as a concept is bigger than the materials used to build it. Babbage’s machines were
                        mechanical, yet the logic behind them anticipates digital systems.

                            <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> worked with Babbage and wrote detailed notes on the Analytical Engine.
                            She described how the machine could follow a series of instructions—an early view of programming.
                            For that reason, she is often credited with writing the first algorithm intended for a machine.

                                Babbage’s projects also show the importance of <strong>funding, project management, and feasibility</strong>.
                                His plans were ambitious and expensive; disagreements with engineers and changing government support
                                slowed progress. This is a useful lesson for modern computing projects—technical brilliance still needs
                                planning, communication, budgeting, and realistic implementation timelines.
                            </p>
                            <p class="body-text">
                                In 1991, the Science Museum in London built a Difference Engine based on Babbage’s original designs
                                and confirmed that the concept worked when manufactured with sufficient precision. This helped prove
                                that Babbage’s engineering ideas were valid—he was simply limited by the tools and circumstances of his time.
